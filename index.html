            <p>Ever since I was 10 years old, cats have held a special place in my heart. It all started with Bonnie, my very first cat, a handsome tuxedo cat with striking black-and-white fur.

            <h2>10 Amusing Facts About Cats</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Purring isn’t just for happiness!</strong> Cats purr not only when they're happy, but also when they’re feeling scared, stressed, or even trying to heal themselves. It's like their built-in "superpower!"</li>
                <li><strong>Cats have a “whisker GPS.”</strong> Whiskers help cats navigate in the dark and sense their surroundings.</li>
                <li><strong>A cat's nose is as unique as a fingerprint.</strong> Every cat’s nose has a unique pattern of ridges and bumps, just like human fingerprints.</li>
                <li><strong>They’re excellent sleepers!</strong> Cats sleep for about 12-16 hours a day—sometimes even up to 20!</li>
                <li><strong>Your cat is a little ninja.</strong> Cats can rotate their ears 180 degrees, thanks to the 32 muscles in each ear.</li>
                <li><strong>Cats don't taste sweet things.</strong> Unlike humans, cats are indifferent to sweets as they lack the receptors for sweetness.</li>
                <li><strong>Kneading isn’t just for bread!</strong> Cats knead with their paws as a sign of contentment.</li>
                <li><strong>Your cat has an invisible alarm clock.</strong> Cats have an uncanny ability to wake their humans at the same time every day.</li>
                <li><strong>Cats “talk” more to humans than each other.</strong> Adult cats meow mostly to communicate with humans, not other cats.</li>
                <li><strong>They’re master contortionists.</strong> Cats can squeeze through almost anything thanks to their flexible bones and bodies.</li>
